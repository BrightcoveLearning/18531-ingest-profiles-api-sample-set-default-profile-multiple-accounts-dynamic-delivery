# 18531-ingest-profiles-api-sample-set-default-profile-multiple-accounts-dynamic-delivery

In this code sample, you will learn how to use the Ingest Profiles API to set the default ingest profile for multiple accounts. You can also set the default profile in the Admin>Ingest Profiles settings in Studio, but this app offers the convenience of setting this for some or all of your accounts at once.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:
